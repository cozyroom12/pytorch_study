## hyper parameter tuning

This will be coverd in later lectures,
but feel free to config using different learnign rates and epochs

Q. how do you find the optimal values of them?
A.
First try setting LR to 0.001
then you'll see the number of epochs which is 1000 at this exercise doesn't look enough since it's not creating a stablized plateau (for the losses graph)

Now try 0.02 for LR
